kern.msgbufsize
		   Sets	the size of the	kernel message buffer.	The default
		   limit of 64KB is usually sufficient unless large amounts of
		   trace data need to be collected between opportunities to
		   examine the buffer or dump it to a file.  Overrides kernel
		   option MSGBUF_SIZE.

The kernel contains a circular message buffer that has a fixed size. The default (as of FreeBSD 12) is 96 KB. Typically that's enough for roughly 1,000 lines on average. You can change the size using the MSGBUF_SIZE kernel configuration option, although that requires building a new kernel.
